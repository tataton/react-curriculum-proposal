# `full-stack-intermediate`

This branch expands on the demonstration project introduced in [`full-stack-basic`](https://github.com/tataton/react-curriculum-proposal/tree/full-stack-basic). Here, we'll connect our Node.js server to external data sources, and display the data on the front end. In the process, we'll introduce some intermediate concepts in React. Our specific goals for this branch (copied from [`master`](https://github.com/tataton/react-curriculum-proposal/tree/master)) are:

* Demonstrate how the Node.js server can coordinate requests to external data sources, without the need for configuring CORS permissions on the client side.
* Explore the difference between stateful and functional stateless components in React.
* Use componentDidUpdate() to regulate DOM re-rendering in response to state updates.
* Illustrate front-end routing, using react-router and the browser history object.
* Write a couple of conponent tests, using Jest.
* Deploy our app to Heroku.
